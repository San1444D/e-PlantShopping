# e-PlantShopping

**e-PlantShopping** is a modern **React-based e-commerce web application** designed for plant enthusiasts. The platform features a visually appealing landing page, categorized product listings (such as air-purifying, aromatic, medicinal, and low-maintenance plants), and a fully functional shopping cart powered by **Redux Toolkit**. 

Users can **browse**, **add plants to their cart**, **adjust quantities**, and **view total costs** in a seamless, responsive interface. Built with **Vite** for fast development and optimized deployment, e-PlantShopping demonstrates skills in **React, Redux, modern CSS,** and frontend architecture.
